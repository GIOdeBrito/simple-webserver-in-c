# Simple Webserver in C

Ever since I've heard and witnessed, on the interweb, that it was possible to create a webserver with the grandfather of modern programming languages, the C language, I have set my heart to try and make my very own.
During an uneventful day at home — whither I slept most of the day away — on which I was watching a debate about certain claims and mistakes on the matter of embryology, it suddenly came to me. Around an hour and half had gone by and after presently realising watching the two forms in the video trading blows in defense, or offense, to Aristotle and the church Fathers, my mind began to wander astray onto other topics. As the two argued on, and the debate flared with visible anger and impatience, the thought of standing idle and watching those two, instead of studying, came to me, and with it, the idea of a webserver in C. The rest is right in the files present in this repository.


## How To Use
It's simple, not many steps to perform, I prefer to work simple and lightweight.

Fork or manually copy the repository. And attend to the requirements below.

First one must first use a Linux operating system, as it is currently hard-coded for it to work only on Linux

## Requirements
- A machine running a Linux system
- The GNU C Compiler

## Build and Run 

```bash
  gcc server.c -o server
  ./server
```

## Testing
To check whether it is working or not, open your web browser on either localhost or 127.0.0.1 on Port 8080.
